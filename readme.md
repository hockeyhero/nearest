# Nearest

Nearest is a service that given a geolocation, radius and possibly other criteria (e.g. age range) returns a set of users within that range. It is my implementation of a web service that, once populated, will answer questions like: 

- who are the players over the age of 35 within 5 miles of me? 
- who are the goalies between the age of 18 and 34 within 2 miles of me? 
- who are the referees within 3 miles of me? 

Nearest needs to be fast and accurate. Nearest is what we are building here.
